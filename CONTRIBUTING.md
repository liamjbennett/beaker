# How To Contribute To Beaker

## Getting Started

* If it is accessible to you, create a [Jira account](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com)
* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
  * Clearly describe the issue including steps to reproduce when it is a bug.
  * File in the appropriate location:
    * Using your [Jira account](http://tickets.puppetlabs.com)
      * Beaker bugs are submitted in the `QENG` project with the `Beaker` component.
    * As a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker/issues?direction=desc&sort=updated&state=open)
* Fork the [Beaker repository on GitHub](https://github.com/puppetlabs/beaker)

## Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
  * This is the `master` branch in the case of Beaker
  * To quickly create a topic branch based on master use `git checkout -b my_contribution master`. Please avoid working directly on the `master` branch.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Check for unnecessary whitespace with `git diff --check` before committing.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format. 

````
    (QENG-1234 OR gh-1234) Make the example in CONTRIBUTING imperative and concrete

    Without this patch applied the example commit message in the CONTRIBUTING
    document is not a concrete example.  This is a problem because the
    contributor is left to imagine what the commit message should look like
    based on a description rather than an example.  This patch fixes the
    problem by making the example concrete and imperative.

    The first line is a real life imperative statement with a ticket number
    from our issue tracker.  The body describes the behavior without the patch,
    why this is a problem, and how the patch fixes the problem when applied.
````
 
* Make sure you have added [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) tests that exercise your new code.  These test should be located in the appropriate `beaker/spec/` subdirectory.  The addition of new methods/classes or the addition of code paths to existing methods/classes requires additional RSpec coverage.
  * Beaker uses RSpec 3.1.0+, and you should **NOT USE** deprecated `should`/`stub` methods - **USE** `expect`/`allow`.  Use of deprecated RSpec methods will result in your patch being rejected.  See a nice blog post from 2013 on [RSpec's new message expectation syntax](http://teaisaweso.me/blog/2013/05/27/rspecs-new-message-expectation-syntax/).
* Make sure that you have added documentation using [Yard](http://yardoc.org/), new methods/classes without apporpriate documentation will be rejected.
* Run the tests to assure nothing else was accidentally broken, using `rake test`
  * **Bonus**: if possible ensure that `rake test` runs without failures for additional Ruby versions (1.9, 1.8, 2.0). Beaker supports Ruby 1.8+, and breakage of support for older/newer rubies will cause a patch to be rejected.
* During the time that you are working on your patch the master Beaker branch may have changed - you'll want to [rebase](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) before you submit your PR with `git rebase master`.  A successful rebase ensures that your patch will cleanly merge into Beaker.
* Submitted patches will be smoke tested through a series of acceptance level tests that ensures basic Beaker functionality - the results of these tests will be evaluated by a Beaker team member.  Failures associated with the submitted patch will result in the patch being rejected.

## Making Trivial Changes

### Maintenance

For changes of a trivial nature, it is not always necessary to create a new ticket in Jira or GitHub. In this case, it is appropriate to start the first line of a commit with `(MAINT)` instead of a ticket/issue number. 

````
    (MAINT) Fix whitespace 

    - remove additional spaces that appear at EOL
````
### Version Bump For Gem Release

To prepare for a new gem release of Beaker the `version.rb` file is updated with the upcoming gem version number.  This is submitted with `(GEM)` instead of a ticket/issue number.

````
     (GEM) Update version for Beaker 1.16.1
````
### History File Update

To prepare for a new gem release of Beaker (after the version has been bumped) the `HISTORY.md` file is updated with the latest GitHub log.  This is submitted with `(HISTORY)` instead of a ticket/issue number.

````
    (HISTORY) Update history for release of Beaker 1.16.1
